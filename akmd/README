This document describes the open-source akmd device. Aftermarket OS makers
should read this document fully to understand the akmd daemon better.

Background
----------

HTC-manufactured Android phones contain within two chips, AKM8973 and BMA150.
The AKM8973 is a magnetometer and temperature sensor, BMA150 is an
accelerometer and temperature sensor. (The AKM8973's temperature sensor
is used to report ambient temperature.)

The userspace driver was reverse-engineered by watching the ioctls performed by
the device and reading the open-source kernel driver and the freely available
technical manuals AK8973_IC-ON-LINE.CN.pdf and
BMA150_DataSheet_Rev.1.5_30May2008.pdf.

Device Coordinate System (DCS)
------------------------.-----

Device Coordinate System is the reference for measurements. Imagine that your
phone is in portrait orientation in your right hand so that index finger
goes along the left edge of the phone and the thumb is placed along the
bottom edge of the phone. The middle finger points away from the device. The
thumb is the x coordinate, index finger the y coordinate and middle finger
the z coordinate. The coordinate axis increase towards the tips of your
fingers.

Approximate programming stack
-----------------------------

1. akmd / C
   - reads hardware, publishes data on /dev/input called "compass"

2. libsensors.so / C++
   - talks to /dev/akm8973_aot to set measurement parameters, reads "compass"

3. Sensor JNI API / C
   - massages data into Java float[] by sensor

4. Sensor / Java
   - represents the measurement in Java side

5. SensorManager / Java
   - handles the application visible sensor service

The layers in the stack appear to swap y/z axis and flip the signs of many
of the measurements from the DCS to something else. I haven't tracked them
all down yet. I know that libsensors flips the sign of roll, acceleration's
X, Z and magnetic fields X and Y.

In addition to that, akmd must flip magnetic field Z and swap the acceleration
Y/Z axis.

Accelerometer
--------------

The raw measurement from BMA150 reports gravity as a negative value when the
device lays on its back on table in the z direction. The value range is
-2 .. 2 G, and reported values are -512 .. 511. The device supports
different acceleration sensitivities, but only the most sensitive is used.

If the device lays on its left edge, the x acceleration is reported negative.
However, if the device is in the portrait orientation, y is reported as
positive. Therefore, the y axis is inverted by akmd to conform to the DCS.

The accelerometer samples data internally 3000 times per second. A fixed
analog filter cuts the sampling rate down to 1500 Hz, and then a 64-tap
boxcar filter is used to drop sampling rate to about 23 Hz. Reducing the
length of the digital filter appears to increase visible errors considerably,
however using higher sampling rates and better filters on akmd side would
probably improve the sensor's results nevertheless.

Magnetic sensor
---------------

The magnetic sensor reports axes consistently with DCS. The values are
reported as 8-bit value from 0 .. 255, and its interpretation depends on given
analog gain, analog offset, and any post-processing the akmd wants to do.

The analog gain is used to multiply the raw sensor measurement by
logarithmically specified factor between 1 and 2. Analog offset can be used
to adjust the measured value to reside close to 0 when no external magnetic
field is applied. The AK8973 suggests setting the parameters so that 1 LSB =
1 uT.

My akmd sets the gain to maximum and attenuates the measurement digitally
towards 1 LSB = 1/16 uT which is expected by the android stack. The analog
offset is adjusted if the akmd notices that the digital result got clipped.
The adjustments should rapidly find a workable setting where normal magnetic
field measurements do not cause further offset changes to occur.

The gain of 0 reads magnetic field variability as something close to -35 .. 35
in HTC Hero. The gain of 15 gives nearly double that, which still fits well
into single 8-bit value.

Also, the analog gain across three axes should be checked to see that the
sensor reports about the same value of the magnetic field in all directions.
Preferably the field's strength would also be calibrated to show the correct
value, but that requires a reference instrument to measure it with. This
akmd is currently not capable of automatically adjusting the magnetic gain.

There is a bug in HTC kernel where setting the magnetic sensor to measuring
mode imparts a 1 millisecond CPU busyloop via mdelay(1) in AKECS_SetMode. The
new kernel function usleep() should be used there.

Yaw, Pitch, Roll
----------------

These values are calculated from accelerometer and compass data. The
yaw (also called azimuth) defines the device's orientation in Earth's
magnetic field. The calculation of azimuth involves discovering the
direction to Earth, projecting the magnetic field to Earth's tangent space
and then calculating the component angle in the tangent space.

Azimuth defined this way does not depend on device's orientation, and the
needle's orientation does not change much when the device is rotated, if
calibration is good.

Pitch and roll are estimated from accelerometer by performing
spherical-to-cartesian transformation. Currently magnetometer reading is not
yet considered, therefore making distinguishing between acceleration and
gravity impossible. This is subject of future work.
