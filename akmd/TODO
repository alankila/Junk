Quick document of things to try/do

- Make a 100 Hz event loop that records BMA150 (with 100 Hz sampling rate)
  and AKM8973 magnetic field. Start/stop this event loop from the aot thread.

- Lowpass filter both to about 25 Hz, perhaps with a 2nd order butterworth,
  or just 4-tap boxcar FIR. Report the data as soon as we have it, because
  the ioctl to do this is not going to cost us much, so we can just ignore
  the delay. (This makes sense because the sensors are going to be filtered
  anyway to about 25 Hz sampling rate, so you can get no more nor any less
  resolution, and it's simpler this way.)

- Update calibration code entirely to float. Fuck integers. Fuck phones
  without FPU. It's going to be fast enough anyway.

- Add condition to sphere fit that fitting only starts after more than 10
  current vectors have been measured. Define current as "has been
  recorded in the last minute". (Add timestamp to structure.) This could
  handle probable thermal drift of the measurements while phone is sleeping.
